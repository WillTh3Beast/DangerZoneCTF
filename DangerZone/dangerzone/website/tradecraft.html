	    <p>Signals intelligence gathering is for the lab-coated geeks. So unless you literally spend all day on a computer and haven't seen the sun in months forget it! I certainly don't know how it works.</p>

            <p class="trade_craft">Double Agent</p>
	    <p>A double agent is an operative who merely pretends to spy on one intelligence agency (Agency A) on behalf of a second intelligence agency (Agency B) but is in reality loyal to the first intelligence agency (Agency A). And I'm already confused, so let's move on.</p>

      <tr>
         <td>
            <p class="trade_craft">False Flag</p>
	    <p>This technique derives its name from pirate times, when the pirates would drive around in their pirate ships, drinking gimlets and flying a non-terrifying, non-skull-and-crossbones festooned flag. The Italian flag, for example. Then some nonpirate ship --probably stuffed to the boat-rafters with slaves and rum-- would see the pirates and, think were just some cool Itailian guys who probably know where the party is. Then they would  wave for the pirates to come over, and just when the pirates got within grappling-hook range... bam! Out comes the ol' Jolly Roger, and then the pirates would plunder the ship.</p>

      <tr>
         <td>
            <p class="trade_craft">Honeypot</p>
	    <p>No this isn't one of those hacker catching honey pots those blue-team guys are into. This honeypot involves a combination of seduction and blackmail. In a honeypot an agent seduces the target and blackmails them. Russian Sparrows like Katya are experts at the honeypot.</p>

      <tr>
         <td>

         <td>
            <p class="trade_craft">MOLE</p>
	    <p>The mole, also known as an "agent in place," is one of the most important aspects of counterintelligence. You ever see Austin Powers Gold Member?</p>
