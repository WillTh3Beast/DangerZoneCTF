Hello Everyone!

I finished the initial release of kill_bang_marry.exe!

The program still needs to go through testing to ensure it is not vulnerable
to attackers. For this reason the program is currently running
locally on localhost port 4321 so you will have to log into the
computer at the office to try it out. Who wants to kill, bang, and/or marry you? 

I have also put the code here so you can try the program out at home. 

Let me know what you guys think!


When you login you can access the program like this:

$ nc localhost 4321
